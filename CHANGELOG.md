---

## [1.0.6] - 2026-06-04

**LUX**
- [Fix] **GOAD deploy (overwrite existing range)** — Wait for Ludus VM destroy to finish before starting GOAD so dynamic inventory does not fail mid-teardown (stuck deploy after VM wipe).
- [Fix] **GOAD deploy (overwrite existing range)** — Regenerate workspace `config.yml` and inventory files before Provide/Install when reusing an existing GOAD instance (`update_instance_files` REPL + `refresh-workspace` API to sync `instance.json` extensions).
- [Fix] **GOAD deploy logs** — Pass `instanceId` into execute, `?goadTaskId=` on redirect, and retry task resume on the instance page so the GOAD log panel streams without a manual refresh.

---

## [1.0.5] — 2026-06-02

**LUX**
- [Add] **Admin → Application Logs** — Admin Application Logs page with live streaming of sign-in and application events. Ludus proxy and LUX API routes log user actions so the Application filter is populated, not only auth events.
- [Add] Structured application event logging for settings, impersonation, user roles, ranges, and GOAD.
- [Fix] Settings admin controls respect current Ludus admin role (live revalidation on session refresh).
- [Fix] **Testing Mode** — PocketBase `testingEnabled` reconciles when Ludus/ansible finishes (op-scoped, log slice after op start) so UI matches backend state.
- [Fix] **Testing Mode** — Op completion follows op-scoped ansible logs first; PocketBase sync is best-effort only. Removed passive pb-status reconcile that could fight in-flight ops and flip `testingEnabled` wrong.
- [Fix] **Testing Mode** — Log markers persisted in SQLite so op completion survives container restart; full-tail fallback when marker missing.
- [Fix] **Range Logs** — History timestamps anchor to ansible.log mtime on Ludus host instead of browser refresh time.
- [Improve] **Testing Mode** — Range selection locked on the Testing page and sidebar Active Range dropdown while start/stop is in progress.
- [Improve] Ludus Performance moved from Settings to Admin → Performance.
- [Security] Shorter session lifetime (eight hours).
- [Security] Login rate limiting to slow down password guessing (one-minute lockout after too many attempts).
- [Security] Stronger upload checks for profile images and the site logo (10 MB logo limit).
- [Security] Safer error pages and API responses in production.
- [Security] Improved web server and TLS settings behind nginx.
- [Security] Console connections use single-use access tokens.
- [Security] Sign-in and sign-out events are written to the application log.
- [Security] **vitest** 4.1.8 — patches GHSA-5xrq-8626-4rwp / CVE-2026-47429

---

## [1.0.4] — 2026-05-28

**LUX**
- [Fix] **Testing Mode** — Start/stop progress labels (button, log panel, alerts) follow PocketBase `testingEnabled` instead of the DB op record, so stopping testing no longer briefly shows "Starting Testing Mode…" while Ludus is still processing.
- [Fix] **Settings → Ludus Performance** — CPU chart reads utilization from Proxmox `pvesh get /cluster/resources` (pvestatd) instead of `/nodes/{node}/status`, which often reported 0% on independent polls.
- [Add] **Settings → About → Release notes** — Keyword search and quick filters by tag (Add, Fix, Enhance, …) across version titles, groups (LUX/GOAD), and descriptions, with match counts, auto-expanded hits, and highlighted terms.
- [Improve] **CHANGELOG** — Retired generic `[Change]` tag; all historical bullets recategorized (see [tag guide](https://github.com/ryokubaka/ludus-ux/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)).
- [Improve] **Ranges Overview** — Hide the **ROOT** user row from Users & Ranges; ROOT is admin-only and not a Ludus utilization user.
- [Docs] **Templates** — New [docs/templates.md](docs/templates.md): how the Templates page works (build, add-from-source, logs), Proxmox permissions for `iso_download_pve`, and troubleshooting `403 Permission check failed` when `AccessNetwork` ACL is on the wrong node (e.g. `/nodes/127.0.0.1` vs `proxmox_node`).

---

## [1.0.3] — 2026-05-26

**LUX**
- [Improve] **Dashboard → VM power** — Per-VM and bulk power on/off stay in a pending/spinning state until Ludus confirms each VM is running or stopped; status shows **Starting…** / **Stopping…**; **All On** / **All Off** spin until every targeted VM confirms (slow Ludus timeouts still poll for confirmation).
- [Fix] **Post-GOAD firewall redeploy banner** — Step 2 no longer sticks after **Deploy Tags: network** succeeds; empty-template Ludus history rows now match in terminal state (not only while `running`), GOAD tasks poll while `phase=network-deploy`, and the dashboard clears stale phase when history already shows completion.
- [Security] **ws** 8.21.0 — patches GHSA-58qx-3vcg-4xpx / CVE-2026-45736; **brace-expansion** 5.0.6+ override — patches GHSA-jxxr-4gwj-5jf2 / CVE-2026-45149.

---

## [1.0.2] — 2026-05-22

**LUX**
- [Fix] **GOAD instance → Extensions tab** — Long extension lists scroll inside the tab panel again (scrollbar visible); same layout fix for **Lab Info** and **Inventories** tabs when content exceeds the viewport.
- [Improve] **GOAD extensions (no new VMs)** — Extensions with no Ludus machines show **Provision** instead of **Install** and confirm Ansible-only enablement (no range deploy). Feature requires modification to GOAD (see [goad-mod](https://github.com/ryokubaka/goad-mod)). Normal GOAD will execute `ludus range deploy` even for a zero-VM extension.

---

## [1.0.1] — 2026-05-14

**LUX**
- [Add] **Quickstart** — `scripts/quickstart.sh` supports **`--full`**, **`--menu`**, and an in-script choice of a lighter **menu** versus the **full wizard** again.
- [Add] **Quickstart** — During interactive setup, the script can install **`sudo`** on the Ludus/Proxmox SSH target where minimal Debian-style installs omit it
- [Improve] **Quickstart** — Publishes your **`SSH_KEY_PATH`/`id_rsa`** public half to the Ludus server to address SSH key only based authentication 
- [Fix] **Range creation `userID`** — Client `ludusApi.createRange` resolves the caller’s Ludus `userID` instead of incorrect `name`
- [Fix] **Admin impersonation** — “Manage as” stores **`userID`**, **`name`**, and **SSH login** separately so Ludus range APIs see the real **`userID`**, SSH/GOAD still use **`proxmoxUsername`** (`name` fallback), instead of collapsing everything into **`name`** and breaking impersonated workflows
- [Fix] **Settings merge** — Empty `proxmoxSshPassword` / `proxmoxSshUser` values stored in SQLite no longer override `PROXMOX_SSH_*` from the environment (same idea as the root API key), so `.env` Proxmox SSH credentials are not masked after a Settings save with blank fields.
- [Fix] **Ranges Overview → shared services (ADMIN pool)** — `/api/admin/shared-vms` and `/api/admin/vm` now authenticate to Proxmox only with configured root SSH: `PROXMOX_SSH_USER`, `PROXMOX_SSH_PASSWORD`, and/or the mounted private key. They no longer reuse the browser session’s Ludus SSH password.
- [Fix] **Shared VM start/stop** — `PUT /api/admin/vm` accepts key-only Proxmox auth (previously required a non-empty password even when a root key was mounted).

**GOAD**
- [Fix] **Long `provide` → `provision_lab` stall** — `goad-ludus-reconcile` now resolves the Ludus range from `.goad_range_id`, SQLite **`goad_instance_ranges`**, or **`deploy_handoffs`** (by `taskId` / `instanceId`) when the SSH sidecar file is missing. **Deploy-poll detection** accepts a few alternate Ludus status strings. **`appendLine` reconcile** no longer joins the entire in-memory GOAD log (was O(n) every 6 lines and could freeze Node on 30+ minute streams); it passes the last **25 000** lines only so PocketBase `SUCCESS` patching keeps up and GOAD can exit `provide` into `provision_lab`.

**Docs**
- [Improve] **Getting started (requirements)** — Optional GOAD row now calls out **`sudo`** on the Ludus server for minimal Debian/Proxmox-style installs (`apt`-style reminder).

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-13

**LUX**
- [Add] First stable release — out of beta!
- [Add] **Range Configuration → Firewall Rules** — Toolbar next to **Apply to Config** adds **Save Config**, **Force** (same testing-mode `--force` flag as the page header), and **Deploy Firewall Rules** (merge rules into YAML, save to Ludus, then deploy with the `network` tag only).
- [Docs] **README** — Root readme is a short overview + quick links; long-form install, SSH, env, features, architecture, dev, API, and screenshots live under **[docs/](docs/index.md)**.
- [Improve] **Range logs → History** — Saved deploy logs show clock times the same way as the live log, in order top to bottom, without confusing extra digits on the time.
- [Improve] **Groups → remove a shared range** — Adding or removing a range from a group may need that range’s **router** machine turned on first. Dialog box now allows router power operations and ability to add/remove from the group.
- [Improve] **Refresh feedback** — Groups, GOAD home (including recent activity), and the console **Reconnect** button show a brief spinner while things load again.
- [Fix] **Range sidebar** — `refreshRanges()` now invalidates every scoped `ranges/accessible` query so deleted ranges disappear reliably after impersonation / cache timing quirks
- [Fix] **Dashboard** — No more brief HTTP 400 error on the home dashboard while a range is deploying or live logs are connecting
- [Fix] **GOAD → Deploy New Instance** — Abort deploy (with toast) when dedicated Ludus range creation fails instead of running GOAD with no `LUDUS_RANGE_ID`; re-select that range and refresh the accessible-range list before redirect so the shell sidebar matches the GOAD lab
- [Fix] **Ludus admin & range creation** — Infer admin API URL when unset; `POST /ranges/create` (and GOAD init-range) use the session Ludus key first, with optional ROOT fallback.
- [Fix] **Settings root API key** — Persists to SQLite, encrypted at rest, env overrides DB, trims BOM/quotes.
- [Security] **Impersonation API key** removed from `sessionStorage` — key lives only in the encrypted `httpOnly` session cookie; all server routes derive it via `resolveAdminImpersonationFromRequest`
- [Security] **Task stream IDOR** — non-admin access to `/api/goad/tasks/:id/stream` for an unknown task now returns 404
- [Security] **Proxy error sanitisation** — internal exception details logged server-side only; client receives generic `"Internal proxy error"`
- [Security] **Impersonation header merge** — both `X-Impersonate-*` headers required together; a single header falls back to the session cookie
- [Perf] **GOAD wizard redirect** — instant redirect to instance page on first `[TASKID]` SSE event; 30-minute poll removed
- [Perf] **TanStack `staleTime` audit** — admin ranges, GOAD instance lists, and task lists promoted to `STALE.medium`

**GOAD**
- [Add] **Resizable log split** — Drag the center handle between **Ludus range logs** and **GOAD logs** on Deploy Status and Logs History; panel widths persist (browser localStorage).
- [Improve] **GOAD deploy history** — History rows read more clearly when a small firewall-only redeploy comes right after a big GOAD run, so labels and GOAD log groupings are less likely to look wrong.
- [Improve] **GOAD terminal** — If the live stream ends without a clear “finished with exit code …” line, the UI still learns success or failure from the server once the task has stopped.
- [Fix] **Range logs** — Ansible line colouring ignores benign JSON `"failed": false`; GOAD instance/new pages fill the shell below the impersonation banner without hard-coded `100vh` offsets.
- [Fix] **Extension Installations** — Lab setup and each add-on now run one after another on the server so nothing gets skipped.

**Docs**
- [Add] `docs/workflows.md` — plain-English guide: Ludus ranges, GOAD instances, two-stage deploy, redeployment, network rules queue, and admin impersonation
- [Add] `docs/architecture.md` — GOAD task flow diagram, SSE stream resume notes, updated design decisions
- [Add] `docs/features.md` — dedicated Admin Impersonation and GOAD redeploy semantics sections
- [Add] `docs/about.md` — GOAD ↔ Ludus relationship summary

## [0.9.9] — 2026-05-07

**LUX**
- [Improve] **Slow Ludus responses** — The app waits longer for heavy work (snapshots, deploys, powering VMs, template builds, testing allow/deny, and similar). If the wait times out but the job might still be running, messaging is clearer and many pages refresh their view instead of only showing a scary error.
- [Improve] **Log timestamps** — Live range/GOAD lines use the Ludus host’s clock when SSH is set up, so times read like the server you’re deploying to—not only the app container’s timezone.
- [Perf] **Post-refresh load time** — PBKDF2 session key is derived once per process (middleware + RSC no longer repeat expensive crypto); TanStack no longer invalidates hydrated range/blueprint cache on every mount; sidebar nav links use `prefetch={false}` to cut RSC storms; server passes a small **shell session** snapshot so the header/sidebar skip redundant `/api/auth/session` calls; effective scope skips a network round-trip when it already matches the server.
- [Add] **Settings → Ludus Performance** — Live charts (CPU, memory, load) for every Proxmox node returned by `pvesh`, polled over root SSH (same auth as SSH & GOAD).
- [Fix] **Snapshots page** — Create, revert, and delete now match what Ludus expects and stay tied to the range you selected, so bulk actions actually run instead of looking like they did nothing.
- [Fix] **Testing mode stop stuck** — Treat Ludus ERROR/ABORTED as terminal for testing ops (Ansible can fail mid-play while state still looks deploying). One automatic `testing/stop` retry after 4 min; POST body `dismissStuckOp` clears a stuck DB op; Testing page shows **Unlock UI** after 90s and toasts on server-reported op failure.

**GOAD**
- [Add] **GOAD lab — Range logs** — **Refresh** on the range log panel reconnects the live stream when new lines stop appearing (handy right after kicking off a deploy).
- [Add] **GOAD lab — Install** — One action runs **Provide** then **Provision lab** with a plain-language confirmation. Action order is Install → Provide → Provision Lab → Sync IPs, then the rest; only **Install** stays highlighted in green.
- [Fix] **GOAD provide → provision (Ludus)** — `goad-ludus-reconcile` uses a **3 MB** Ludus log tail (was 200 KB), strips `[HH:MM:SS]` prefixes before PLAY RECAP parsing, throttled `[goad-ludus-reconcile]` diagnostics when root API key / `instanceId` / `.goad_range_id` / admin range state are missing or `/range/logs` fails, **8** deploy-poll lines when recap is only in Ludus logs (was 10), and reconcile runs every **12** GOAD log lines (was 18).

## [0.9.8] — 2026-05-06

**LUX**
- **[Breaking] Docker / TLS layout** — Compose includes an **nginx** edge container (`ludus-ux-web`) for HTTPS on host **:443**; Defaults **`DISABLE_HTTPS=true`** + **`TRUST_PROXY_TLS=true`** so session cookies stay correct behind TLS termination. 
  - **TLS PEMs** for nginx moved from repo-root **`certificates/`** to **`docker/nginx/certificates/`** (`cert.pem`, `key.pem`) — **migrate files** before or after pull; nginx generates self-signed certs on first boot if missing.
- [Fix] Admin delete user — purge PocketBase `logs` rows that reference the user (`POST /api/users/purge-pocketbase-logs`) before Ludus `DELETE /user`; fixes referential integrity errors when deploy-run history exists
- [Fix] GOAD terminal word wrap — inner `<pre>` replaced with `<div>` (`white-space: pre` blocked wrapping); wrap on by default; scroll pane `min-w-0` for flex shrink
- [Improve] Light log theme — black body text on GOAD terminal and shared `LogViewer`; Ansible / PLAY RECAP line colours for light backgrounds via `ansibleClassForTheme`

**GOAD**
- [Fix] `provide` stuck on **deployment in progress (DEPLOYING)** after Ansible **PLAY RECAP** succeeds — LUX watches streamed GOAD logs; when Ludus never flips PocketBase `rangeState` off DEPLOYING/WAITING, writes **SUCCESS** via PB (same escape hatch as abort; requires configured Ludus root API key and root SSH to read `.goad_range_id`)
- [Fix] Dedicated-range deploy uses the logged-in API user — seed missing `~/.goad/goad.ini` with GOAD’s stock sections plus `[ludus] use_impersonation=no` before `goad.sh` (GOAD does not overwrite an existing file)
- [Fix] Ludus CLI shim omits `--range` for `ludus user …` so `user list` / `user list all` match GOAD expectations
- [Fix] When `LUDUS_RANGE_ID` is set, patch `use_impersonation=no` before and after `goad.sh` so stale configs cannot re-enable synthetic-user mode mid-session

---

## [0.9.7] — 2026-05-04

**LUX**
- [Add] Playwright smoke (`npm run test:e2e`) — optional `E2E_*` env vars; see `config/playwright.config.ts`
- [Add] Playwright: health, auth-gate, login UI, navigation, logout (`e2e/helpers/auth.ts`)
- [Improve] Tooling layout: `config/next.config.cjs`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`, `postcss.config.cjs`, and `tsconfig.base.json` under `config/`
- [Perf] TanStack cache + `localStorage` namespaced per login/impersonation scope (`@sc` query keys); dashboard inventory cache keyed by scope; manual refresh no longer blocked by 15s poll
- [Fix] Admin manual impersonation waits for `/api/auth/impersonate` cookie before navigating home
- [Fix] Login: derive `isAdmin` from the correct Ludus `GET /user` row when the API returns an array; fixes missing admin sidebar for real admins
- [Fix] Stop calling Ludus `GET /range` without `rangeID` (404 on v2); dashboard range query waits for selection; logs page passes `rangeID`; remove SSR prefetch that hit bare `/range`
- [Fix] Dashboard: merge partial or empty `GET /range` VM lists with cached rows — use `numberOfVMs` when it exceeds `VMs.length`, union-merge subset responses; manual refresh / 15s poll no longer intermittently drops VMs

---

## [0.9.6] — 2026-04-29

**LUX**
- [Add] Range Configuration: optional **Force save & deploy** (`--force`) for Ludus testing mode — applies to config upload and to `POST /range/deploy`
- [Add] Dashboard: **Destroy all VMs** (range object kept) via `DELETE /range/{rangeID}/vms`; confirmation copy contrasts with **Delete Range**
- [Add] VM Operations audit entry for bulk destroy-all-VMs
- [Fix] `ConfirmBar` preserves newline characters in multi-line confirmation prompts (`whitespace-pre-line`)
- [Fix] Configuration page: removed non-functional yaml-language-server schema tip banner
- [Security] **postcss** 8.5.10+ (CVE-2026-41305 / GHSA-qx2v-qp2m-jg93) — direct devDependency; `overrides.next.postcss` so Next’s nested copy matches patched release

---

## [0.9.5] — 2026-04-28

**LUX**
- [Add] Additional controls on streamed and static logs — pause (freeze display while the buffer keeps filling), toggle auto-follow, font size stepper (A− / A+), word-wrap, light vs dark log pane, search with match navigation, copy all, download, clear
- [Add] Shared `LogDockToolbar` across `LogViewer` (Dashboard, Range Logs, Templates, Testing, Range Config, …) and `GoadTerminal` (GOAD instance pages); Range Logs toolbar shows Live when SSE is connected
- [Fix] Log body font-size now follows the toolbar (`.log-line` no longer pinned `text-xs`, which blocked resizing on Ludus Ansible output)
- [Fix] noVNC resolves the Proxmox node from cluster resources by VMID before creating the VNC proxy ticket, instead of assuming the first node.
- [Fix] noVNC missing-password errors now clearly explain that Proxmox HTTP tickets require the user's PAM password; SSH keys still work for SPICE and `pvesh` paths only.
- [Fix] noVNC now authenticates to Proxmox as the logged-in LUX user's PAM account (`proxmoxUsername@pam`) using the user's session password, instead of reusing `PROXMOX_SSH_USER` / root PAM credentials.
- [Security] `proxmoxSshPassword` saved from the Settings UI is encrypted at rest in SQLite using `APP_SECRET`; existing plaintext values are rewritten encrypted on next settings load.
- [Docs] README now separates root SSH auth from browser-console PAM auth and adds VNC 401 troubleshooting.
- [Docs] Quickstart now explains the optional root `PROXMOX_SSH_PASSWORD` and that in-browser noVNC uses the logged-in user's password.
- [Docs] `scripts/upgrade.sh` — upgrade/downgrade helper; quiet `git fetch`, lists active remote branches and tags via `git ls-remote` (no stale deleted branches), supports tag checkout; README section updated.

---

## [0.9.4] — 2026-04-20

**LUX**

- [Fix] Network YAML comparison now semantic — eliminates false-positive post-GOAD firewall deploys
- [Fix] Trailing quote removed from GOAD Logs History extension names
- [Fix] Ansible `{{ range_id }}` resolved to actual value in VM operation audit entries
- [Add] GOAD task phase, network flags, and start time persisted server-side in SQLite
